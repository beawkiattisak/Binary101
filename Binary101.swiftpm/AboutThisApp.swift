# Binary 101

``For the best experience, use the iPad Pro 11-inch, 4th generation for simulator. (Portrait Orientation)``

# Inside the app
Welcome to the Binary101 app! I'm excited for you to explore learning the basics of binary! Here is some information to help you get started.

In the app, there are 4 topics such as:
- Tutorial (Addition): It will teach users to add binary on 4 tutorial pages. The button at the bottom of the page is disabled by default, but if the user clicks the button and the answer is correct, the button will change from gray to black and enable.

- Binary Addition: On this page, there is a puzzle binary addition game with random binary, an endless game. If the user inputs the correct answer and submits, it will show a correct alert, but if incorrect, it will show a try-again message.

- Converter: On this page, there is a binary-to-text and text-to-binary converter. There is a swap button at the center of the text field to switch between binary-to-text and text-to-binary modes.

- Algorithm Vault: On this page, there are details of algorithms and sample code. I have included only 2 algorithms on this page, such as Binary Search and Binary Tree.

I hope you have an amazing experience learning binary with my application!

# Who Am I
Hello, my name is Kiattisak Sanburee, and I am 16 years old. I live in Thailand and study at Assumption College Rayong in the Science-Engineering Program.
 
 # Why I make this application?
 
 I discovered that all students in my science and engineering classes don't know about binary. It inspired me to create this application to teach them the basics of binary.

I also created a code community at my school, and I hope everyone knows coding. This is my second attempt at the Swift Student Challenge. The first attempt was an application called "BrailleGuess," and the link to the submission video is at the topic of #Other Information, but it was rejected.
